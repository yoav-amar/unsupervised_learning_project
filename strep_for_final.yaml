0. Abstract
1. Introduction - in the end. maybe 
    - historical scanning
    - One word about
        - statistical tests
        - algorithms
        - dimention reduction
        - norm

2. methods
    - dataset
    - Data reduction
        - all kind of data reduction
    - special metrix + specific algorithms for mixed data
    - statistical tests
    - Finding the optimal number of clusters

3. results
    - Choosing the best number of clusters (maybe split to 2)
    - Best clustering algorithm
    - visualization

4. Discussion
    - tell a story

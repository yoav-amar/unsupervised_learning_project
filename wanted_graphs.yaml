which graphs we want:
  wire matrix sub plot:
    - k-prototype - elbow (yoav) - result done ✅
    - k-prototype (may for the other dude)- elbow (yoav) I don't think it is a must, 
      we can add it if we want another quater of a page ❄️
    - dbscan yoav_matrix - hitmap of epsilon, min_samples of score with -1- (yoav) ✅ 
    - same for spectral
    - same for gmm
    - same for hdbscan

  for each algoritm (kmeans, gmm, dbscan, hdbscan, spectral, fuzzy cmeans):
  - plot of score (Y) to dimention reduction method. (like figure 2 of oshreit)

  2 tables for statistical tests:
    - pass
  

  best clustring algorithm:
  - Silhouette for **all** algorithms (like figure 2 of oshreit)
  - MI for all (?)

  TSNE of best:
  - maybe one maybe more
